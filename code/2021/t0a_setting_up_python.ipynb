    "As is true in human language, there are [hundreds of computer programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages). While each has its own merit, the major languages for scientific computing are C, C++, R, MATLAB, Python, Java, Fortran and Julia. [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) are similar in syntax and typically read as if they were written in plain English. This makes all three languages a useful tool for teaching but they are also very powerful languages and are **very** actively used in real-life research. MATLAB is proprietary while Python and Julia are open source. A benefit of being open source is that anyone can write and release packages. For science, there are many wonderful community-driven packages such as the Python packages [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org), [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org), and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) just to name a few.
