    "Here we will discuss the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift using two approaches: firstly through the analytical definition of the allele frequency over time and secondly through a computational simulation. This tutorial illustrates the role that genetic drift plays in evolution **in the absence of selection** as well as the value of computing results in multiple ways.\n",
