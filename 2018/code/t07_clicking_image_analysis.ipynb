    "The beauty of the model is that it makes strict quantitative predictions of how the gene dosage, i.e. the  number of copies and level of expression of the *bicoid* gene in the fly genome, should affect the location of this morphological feature. So in order to test this model, in the homework you will use Python to measure the cephalic furrow position for different gene dosage embryos. This tutorial will show you the tools to do so. You should read the homework for more details on the biology and the why questions; this tutorial will focus on the computing side of things."
