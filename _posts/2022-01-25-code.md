## Tutorials
We will have several computational tutorials throughout the course. 

## Syllabus for Computational Sessions and Datasets 

We introduce you to several techniques, such as numerical integration, image segmentation and plotting with dashboards. The following syllabus is subject to change and will be kept in line with the class:

- Day 1: Exponential growth: numerical integration by Forward Euler
- Day 2: Bacterial growth: image segmentation and linear regression
- Day 3: 1D diffusion and FRAP
- Day 4: Stochastic simulations: mRNA production and degradation
- Day 5: Image processing: Electron microscope images of virions
- Day 6: Exploring real world datasets: Proteomics
- Day 7:
