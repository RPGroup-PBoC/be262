## Tutorials
We will have several computational tutorials throughout the term. As the course
progresses, these materials will be posted below. **Note:** *In some browsers (Firefox primarily), the end of each sentence is clipped off, making it difficult to read. If this is occurring, please try using another browser (Chrome, Safari, etc).*

* [Tutorial 0a: Configuring your computer]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/t0a_setting_up_python.html) \| This tutorial will walk you through how to install a Python 3.6 scientific computing environment.

* [Tutorial 0b: Using the Jupyter notebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/t0b_jupyter_notebooks.html) \| This tutorial will teach you how to write code and text in Jupyter notebooks for homework submissions.

* [Tutorial 0c: A Primer on Python Syntax]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/t0c_python_syntax_and_plotting.html) \| This tutorial will walk you through the basics of programming in Python.

## Data sets
Please download the following data sets, unzip them, and place them in your `pboc/data` folder as described in [the setting up Python tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/t0a_setting_up_python.html).

* [Data set 1](http://rpdata.caltech.edu/courses/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip) \| Set of phase contrast and fluorescence images of a growing *E. coli.* colony.


## Exercises
As we progress through the course, the code written in class will be posted here, along with the polished version of the same material.

* Exercise 1 \| Inferring bacterial growth rate from microscopy data. \[ [Data set 1](http://rpdata.caltech.edu/courses/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip) \] \[[In class]({{site.baseurl}}/code/bacterial_growth_in_class.html)\]
